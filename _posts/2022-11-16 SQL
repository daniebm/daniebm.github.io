SQL is one of the most widely used tools in the world of data analytics, for which I show below some of the syntaxes that I have used in queries in my previous work as well as in university projects that have required the SQL programming language.

It should be noted that SQL is a tool that I have used to connect with other applications such as:
- Knime
- Power BI

This fusion of tools makes more powerful the process of extracting data and transforming it into results that help decision making.


{% highlight ruby %}
select ename, length(ename), nvl(NULLIF(to_char(length(ename)), to_char(5)), 'length is 5') as result, sal from emp 
where sal > 2000
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
